            <h1>   THE FOUR RULES THAT DECIDE THE RELATION SHIP BETWEEN US AND GOD</h1>
    <h2>1. GOD LOVES YOU</h2>
    <h3 >Gods love</h3>
<p> For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,that whosoever believenth in him should not perish,but have ever lasting life. Jhon 3:16</p>
 <h3>Gods plan</h3>
 <p>The thief cometh not,but for to steal, and to kill and to destroy:I am come tht they might have life,and that they might have it more abundently. jhon 10:10
<p>
 <h2>2. EVERY ONE IS A SINNER</h2>
<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Romans 3:23</p>
 
<h2>3.THE ONLY WAY THAT DELIVERS US TO GOD</h2>
<p> HE DIES INSTEAD OF US-But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Rom 5:8</p>
<p> HE RISEEN FROM DIE- For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1cor 15:8 </p>
<P> JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY -Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. JHON 14:6 </P>
not only knowing the three rules is not sufficient rather thfe fourth rule is neccery.
<h2> 4. WE MUST ACCEPT JESUS AS THE ONLY SAVIOUR FOR US THEN WE CAN PRACTICE THE GOD'S LOVE AND PLAN IN OUR LIFE</h2>
<h3>WE MUST ACCEPT CRIST FAITHFULLY.</h3>
<p>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:jhon1:12</p>
<p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.Eph 2:8-9  </p>
<h2>finally After accepting and Believing Jesus as a saviour of us he gives for us the following us he said in the bible</h2>
 <h3>1. Jesus comes to your life </h3>
 <P> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
 :col 1:27</P>
<h3>2. Your every Sins are forgiven </h3>
<p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins col 1:14
    <h3>3. you become the son of God</h3>
    <p>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:jhon 1:12</p>
    <h3>4. you get the eternal life</h3>
    <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.jhon 5:24</p>
    <h3>5. you started the hilarious journey that God plans to creat you </h3>
    <p> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
        2cor 5:17</p>
        <P>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 1tess 15:18</P>
        <h1>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved Ecc 4:12</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(106, 40, 212)">መዳንም በሌላ በማንም የለም፤ እንድንበት ዘንድ የሚገባን ለሰዎች የተሰጠ ስም ከሰማይ በታች ሌላ የለምና። የሐዋርያት ሥራ 4:12
